# Carabiner Project

This repository provides 3D models for carabiners. To improve strength and durability, it is recommended to use PETG material for printing, as PLA is more prone to breaking under pressure.

## Models

- **Totoro Carabiner**: A 3D model of a carabiner shaped like Totoro.
  - `totoro.stl`: Standard single-color model.
  - `totoro-ams.stl`: Multi-color version of the Totoro carabiner model.
  - `totoro.3mf`: 3MF file of the standard Totoro model.
  - `totoro-ams.3mf`: 3MF file of the multi-color Totoro model.

## Printing Recommendations

- **Material**: It is recommended to use PETG material for printing, as it is stronger and more durable than PLA. PLA is more prone to breaking under pressure, so PETG is a better choice for functional prints like carabiners.
- **Printer Settings**: Ensure that you use appropriate temperature settings for PETG to achieve the best adhesion and strength. It is recommended to use a printer with a heated bed.
- **Multi-color Printing**: The `-ams` versions of the models are designed for multi-color printing. If you have a printer that supports multi-material printing, these files will allow you to print multi-color carabiners.

## Usage Recommendations

- The carabiner models in this project are only recommended for everyday use and are not suitable for high-risk activities like work at heights. Due to the strength limitations of 3D printed materials, please ensure that safety guidelines are followed when using these models.
- The `.stl` files can be used with most slicing software to print your custom carabiner.
- The `.3mf` files are pre-configured and can be opened directly in Orca or Bambu Studio for easy printing.
- Be sure to test the model before printing to ensure proper fit and strength.

## Future Models

More carabiner designs will be added in the future. Stay tuned for more creative and functional designs.
